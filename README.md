# psyqvsce README

The psyqvsce extension for Visual Studio Code adds support for the PsyQ SDK, aiming to aid PS1 game development.

## Features

The psyqvsce extension's features range from compiling and running your game with one click to automatically compiling and running on line edits. It also offers quick tools for opening provided tools with PsyQ, such as Timtool, Vagedit, etc., without needing to open the file explorer. Similarly, all documentation is labeled and can be opened with the PDF reader of your choice with just a few mouse clicks. As of now, the only emulator planned for support is PCSX-Redux.
